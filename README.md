Server plugin will be coming when server files have been released.

A client id and key can be acquired by contacting us

## APIs

To run the client Steam and IPHub API keys are required.

## todo

- [ ] mode that doesnt rely on cftools services and can work independently
- [ ] config files instead of requesting configs/serverlists from master
- [ ] scripts for starting/stopping (run client in background)
- [ ] remove unnecessary debugging blocks
- [ ] create server addon when the server files become available
- [ ] update observer to actually do something
